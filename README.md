## Knowledge Graph Construction for Tom Hanksâ€™ Wikipedia Page 
This project aims to create a basic Knowledge Graph for the Wikipedia page of Tom Hanks, combining traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods and modern language models for relation extraction. Entities are detected using the "urchade/gliner_medium-v2.1" model from the GLiNER library, while relationship extraction between these entities leverages Llama3 to capture more nuanced connections. The result is a structured graph of key entities and relationships that represent information from the page in an interconnected, queryable form.
